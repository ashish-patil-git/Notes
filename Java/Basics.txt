Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.


	1. The Java programming language is a high-level object-oriented language that has a particular syntax and style.

	2. A Java platform is a particular environment in which Java programming language applications run.


Java Programming Language Platforms

There are four platforms of the Java programming language:
	• Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE)
	• Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
	• Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME)
	• JavaFX


All Java platforms consist of a Java Virtual Machine (VM) and an application programming interface (API). 

	1. The Java Virtual Machine is a program, for a particular hardware and software platform, that runs Java technology applications. 

	2. An API is a collection of software components that you can use to create other software components or applications.

Each Java platform provides a virtual machine and an API, and this allows applications written for that platform to run on any compatible system with all the advantages of the Java programming language: platform-independence, power, stability, ease-of-development, and security.
