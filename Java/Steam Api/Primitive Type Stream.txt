IntStream, DoubleStream, LongStream
Methods to convert reference Stream to primitive streams
	- mapToInt, mapToDouble, and mapToLong
Method to convert primitive stream back to Reference Stream
	- boxed, mapToObj
Special Methods of primitive streams
	- sum, max(returns OptionalInt, OptionalDouble, OptionalLong), min(returns OptionalInt, OptionalDouble, OptionalLong)

IntStream, LongStream special static method
	range(1, 100), rangeClosed(1, 100) to generate range of values, range's method second parameter is exclusive

Infinite Streams - The Streams API provides two static methods to generate a stream from a function: Stream.iterate and Stream.generate.

	- Stream.iterate(0, n -> n + 2).limit(10).forEach(System.out::println);
		Iterate Takes UnaryOperator<T>

	- Stream.generate(Math::random).limit(5).forEach(System.out::println);
		generate Takes Supplier<T>

	- Both the static methods are also available in primitive stream classes (IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream)
	- Always should be used with limit operation
